Microservices Kubernetes Deployment Assessment (Link)
Total Marks: 50
Time Limit: 1 hour

Objective
Deploy a microservices application on Kubernetes using Minikube, ensuring proper service communication and configuration.

Application Components
You are provided with four containerized Node.js microservices:

User Service (Port 3000)

Product Service (Port 3001)

Order Service (Port 3002)

Gateway Service (Port 3003)

Task Requirements
1. Basic Kubernetes Deployment (30 marks)
A. Create Kubernetes Deployment manifests for all services (18 marks)
User Service deployment

Product Service deployment

Order Service deployment

Gateway Service deployment  (includes additional proxy handling setup if required)

Each deployment must include:

Correct container image reference

Resource limits and requests

Environment variables

Liveness and readiness probes

Proper labels and selectors

      B. Create corresponding Service resources (12 marks)
Configure correct ports

Choose proper service types

Enable cluster-level service discovery using ClusterIP


2. Minikube Setup and Validation (15 marks)
Initialize and configure Minikube 

Deploy all components successfully 

Validate inter-service communication using curl or logs 

3. Documentation and Testing (5 marks)
Provide a well-structured README.md with:

Minikube setup steps

Deployment process using kubectl apply -f

Service testing instructions using kubectl port-forward or direct service names

Troubleshooting tips

Include screenshots of:

Running pods (kubectl get pods)

Logs showing service communication

Any port-forwarded test results


Bonus Task: Ingress Configuration (Optional)
If you complete the main tasks early, you may choose to implement ingress as a bonus.

Enable Ingress controller on Minikube


Create Ingress resource with routing rules 

Configure paths:


/api/users → User Service


/api/products → Product Service


/api/orders → Order Service


/ → Gateway Service


Apply host-based rules and path mapping
